      <strong>Personal background:</strong> I am a twenty-year-old from Charlotte. I enjoy music, skateboarding, and being outside with nature. <br>
      <strong>Academic background:</strong> This is my second year here at CPCC. I graduated high school in 2022 and am working towards a two-year degree in Full Stack Programming. <br>
      <strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I have no background history with programming outside of coursework projects from other classes and personal projects for experience. <br>
      <strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Desktop PC with Windows 11. <br>
      <strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong> <br>
      <strong>Web115</strong> - I am taking this course to further advance my knowledge and experience with front-end programming. <br> 
      <strong>Web140</strong> - I am taking this course to improve on building websites altogether. <br>
      <strong>DBA120</strong> - I am taking this course so I can learn about databases and get familiar with SQL programming.<br>
      <strong>Funny/Interesting item about myself:</strong> I went to Mumbai, India in late 2023 for my sister's wedding, since my brother-in-law is from there and most of his family currently still lives there.<br> It was a great experience, and seeing the differences between an American and Indian wedding was unbelievable.
